the next feature i would like to add to the app is:

with the URL I want to be able to pass a call  a function that would retrieve all images in a series.
here is an example URL https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-1.jpg. the function call will be an enclosed square brackets [1-20] - the URL will look like this https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-[1-20].jpg. the return results will be display as a series of image one after another. so all URLs from https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-1.jpg  to https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-20.jpg. if any URL result in the series is not an image then don't attempt to the display that image. All with the input field - if the URL has the series function don't return an error message instead return the message "Image Series".

also please review all the code you generated and consider change the overall code for improvements.




i would like to  modify the function that would retrieve all images in a series. currently the function call is enclosed in square brackets [1-20]. the URL function call looks like this https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-[1-20].jpg. The function generates numbers 1,2,3 and so on till 20. example (https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-3.jpg). I would like it function additionally to allow a leading 0 to be generated for number 1 to 9. here is the new example https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-[01-20].jpg will generate URLs  https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-01.jpg to https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-09.jpg and then https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-10.jpg to https://somewebsite.com/gallery/cars/image-20.jpg


function handleImageSeries(url) {
    const urlPattern = url.match(/(.*\[)(\d+)-(\d+)(\].*)/);
    if (urlPattern) {
        const prefix = urlPattern[1].replace('[', '');
        const startNum = parseInt(urlPattern[2], 10);
        const endNum = parseInt(urlPattern[3], 10);
        const suffix = urlPattern[4].replace(']', '');

        let imageUrls = [];
        for (let i = startNum; i <= endNum; i++) {
            imageUrls.push(`${prefix}${i}${suffix}`);
        }
        fetchImage(imageUrls);
        displayMessage('Image Series');
    } else {
        displayError('Invalid series URL format.');
    }
}
